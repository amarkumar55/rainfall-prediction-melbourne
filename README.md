# rainfall-prediction-melbourne
This project builds a machine learning classifier to predict whether it will rain on a given day in the Melbourne region using historical weather data. The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
